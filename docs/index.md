# Passwork Provider

The Passwork provider can be used to manage resources resources on the password manager [Passwork](https://passwork.de/), including vaults, folders and passwords.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    passwork = {
      source = "registry.terraform.io/lupa95/passwork"
    }
  }
}

provider "passwork" {
  host    = "https://my-passwork-instance.com/api/v4" # Can also be passed by the environment variable PASSWORK_HOST
  api_key = "my-api-key" # Can also be passed by the environment variable PASSWORK_API_KEY
}

resource "passwork_vault" "example" {
  name       = "example-vault"
}

resource "passwork_password" "example" {
  name        = "example-password"
  vault_id    = passwork_vault.example.id
  password    = "my-secret-password"
}
```

## Authentication

The provider supports authentication via an API key. Users can retrieve an API key by following these steps:

1. Login to Passwork
2. Navigate to the Account settings
3. Open the API-Settings
4. Enter the authorization password or click "Log in via SSO"
5. Click on "Enable API"

## Development

If you want to develop the provider, the following steps can be done to set up a local development environment.

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lupa95/terraform-provider-passwork
```

2. Make changes and compile the provider:

```bash
go install
```

3. Create the file `~/.terraform.rc` and point to the local sources (GOPATH):

```bash
provider_installation {

  dev_overrides {
      "registry.terraform.io/hashicorp/passwork" = "[insert GOPATH]/bin"
  }
  direct {}
}
```

## Run Tests

Running tests requires access to a Passwork instance.

1. Setup Provider configuration: 
```bash
export PASSWORK_API_KEY=<replace-with-api-key>
export PASSWORK_HOST=https://<replace-with-URL>/api/v4
export PASSWORK_VAULT_ID=<replace with ID of existing Vault> # Required for data source testing
```

2. Run tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
TF_ACC=1 go test -v

# Run tests for specific resource, e.g. password resource only:
TF_ACC=1 go test -v -run TestPasswordResource
```
